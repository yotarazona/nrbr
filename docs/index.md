## About NRBR

🔥 The **Normalized Radar Burn Ratio (NRBR)** Index is an innovative tool that maps burn scars using Sentinel-1 C-SAR data, overcoming cloud cover and smoke limitations. By fusing radar (Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) imagery, we deliver robust, all-weather burn scars assessments for:

- Global monitoring in cloud-prone regions.
- Multi-sensor synergy: Enhanced accuracy via SAR’s penetration + optical’s spectral resolution.
- Rapid response: Day/night detection, critical for post-fire recovery.
- Ecosystem resilience: Data-driven restoration prioritization.

🛰️ Why radar? 

While optical sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) rely on sunlight, Sentinel-1’s C-band radar reveals structural changes in burned vegetation—rain or shine. The **NRBR** algorithm leverages this advantage, transforming raw data into actionable insights for researchers, agencies, and decision makers.

🚀 Wildfires leave scars—track them with satellite intelligence.
