## About NRBR

üî• Wildfires leave scars‚Äîtrack them with satellite intelligence. The **Normalized Radar Burn Ratio (NRBR)** Index is an innovative tool that maps burn scars using Sentinel-1 C-SAR data, overcoming cloud cover and smoke limitations. By fusing radar (Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) imagery, we deliver robust, all-weather burn scars assessments for:

- Global monitoring in cloud-prone regions.
- Multi-sensor synergy: Enhanced accuracy via SAR‚Äôs penetration + optical‚Äôs spectral resolution.
- Rapid response: Day/night detection, critical for post-fire recovery.
- Ecosystem resilience: Data-driven restoration prioritization.

üõ∞Ô∏è Why radar? While optical sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) rely on sunlight, Sentinel-1‚Äôs C-band radar reveals structural changes in burned vegetation‚Äîrain or shine. The **NRBR** algorithm leverages this advantage, transforming raw data into actionable insights for researchers, agencies, and first responders.

## Wildfire

> Human actions are driving significant changes in land cover, intensifying climate change challenges and posing critical threats to communities and ecosystems. These changes arise from various processes and drivers, operating at different scales. It is crucial to capture these diverse processes explicitly in space and time to support scientific and societal applications that go beyond mere geographic representation of disturbances. Wildland fires offer a unique chance to study the role of abrupt land cover change, gradual recovery, and the establishment of new equilibria. Satellite remote sensing provides valuable data on fire location, magnitude, and recovery.
